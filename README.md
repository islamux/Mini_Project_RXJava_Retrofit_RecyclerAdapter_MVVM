*All steps have been explained using comments.

Old and new solutions (shortcuts) were explained, then the shortcut solutions were adopted.

Dependency issues were resolved and libraries were updated.

Problems resulting from library updates were solved.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each point:

1. All steps have been explained using comments:

This means that the code has been annotated with comments that explain what each step does. This makes it easier for someone else to understand the code and how it works.

2. Old and new solutions (shortcuts) were explained, then the shortcut solutions were adopted:

This means that both the old and new ways of doing things were explained, and then the new, more efficient way was chosen.

3. Dependency issues were resolved and libraries were updated:

This means that any problems with the code's dependencies were fixed, and the libraries were updated to the latest versions.

4. Problems resulting from library updates were solved:

This means that any problems that were caused by updating the libraries were fixed.
